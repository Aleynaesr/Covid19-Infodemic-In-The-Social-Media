#  Covid19-Infodemic/Misinformation-In-The-Social-Media



 Social media appear as very important channels for accessing, producing and sharing news. With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, people turned to social media to read and to share timely information including statistics, warnings, advice, and inspirational stories. Unfortunately, alongside all this useful information, there was also a new blending of medical and political misinformation and disinformation, which gave rise to the first global infodemic.
The COVID-19 Pandemic has brought a new dimension to the fake news problem. Thusly, Misinformation as an important problem in the social environment.
Misinformation cause to mislead the society and create perception.
In this case, the fake news produced during the epidemic period spread just like a virus. 
The World Health Organization defined this situation as the Misinformation Pandemic with the term "Infodemic". 
The purpose of this study is to examine which Ä°nfodemic about Covid 19 generally published on social media, how and through which channels.
In many countries of the world, verification platforms that work to combat fake news have examined thousands of suspicious content and informed their readers by verifying this information, especially from social media. I will analyse these social media platforms about verifying misinformation and spreading of misinformation in the most popular platforms.
