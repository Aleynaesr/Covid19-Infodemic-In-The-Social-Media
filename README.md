#### _Covid-19 Infodemic/Misinformation In The Social Media_

 
 ## _Problem Description_
 
#### _Social media appear as very important channel for accessing, producing and sharing news. In this case, with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, people turned to social media to read and to share timely information including statistics, warnings, advice, and inspirational stories. Thus, everyone could access and even distribute information about the epidemic and information began to come from more than one points with right or wrong sources to fill the information gap about Covid 19. Unfortunately, alongside all this useful information, there are also a new blending of medical and political misinformation and disinformation because during this pandemic period, information is not spread in a controlled manner, especially on social media. Accordingly, due to the social panic triggered by the Covid 19 epidemic, it was inevitable that new problems would arise in the field of information and news reliability related to Covid 19 in the socail media. As a result, misinformation and conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 pandemic, the source, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of the disease began to spread through social media channels. Especially during the onset and rapid spread of the epidemic in all countries, the increase in the share of unrealistic news that may affect the masses of the disease has reached alarming dimensions. For example, when we have spent time online in the past few months, we probably all feel the difficulty of determining what information about the coronavirus vaccine is reliable and what is not. In this case, false news generally start to spread faster than factual news, in part due to its novelty and its capacity to generate emotive response. Thusly, misinformation as an important problem in the social environment and it causes rapidly to mislead the society and create perception. As a result of that, in early February 2020, The World Health Organization defined this situation as the Misinformation Pandemic with the term "Infodemic". An infodemic refers too much information including false or misleading information in digital and physical environments during a disease outbreak such as the current pandemic. At the same time, false information is false or inaccurate information intended to be deliberately deceptive. So, an infodemic situation accelerates and sustains misinformation just like the current Covid 19 pandemic. To conclude, I can say that, with the Covid 19 pandemic, excessive information circulating on social media, in other words Infodemic, has brought a new dimension to the problem of misinformation and there is a struggle with both Covid 19 and Infodemic during this pandemic period. In this case, COVID-19 is not only a public health challenge and it’s also a public information challenge.
 

 ## _Introduction_
 
#### _With growing digitization and an expansion of social media use, information spread more rapidly. Everywhere in the world, the Covid 19 pandemic has created an unprecedented level of knowledge in the social media environment. Thus, the Covid 19 pandemic is accompanied by a worldwide Infodemic and misinformation. Infodemic is a concept that gained importance with the COVID-19 pandemic and in this way Covid 19 was recorded as the first global infodemic. World Health Organization (WHO) named the “over-abundance of information” around the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. In this case, with the coming together of too much information, it caused the wrong and the right to be mixed with each other and the trust in the right information started to be affected as much. In the information age, this Infodemic phenomenon is amplified through social networks, spreading farther and faster like a virus. In this way, Infodemic or midinformation can come from a range of sources especially social media platforms such as YouTube, Twitter and Instagram that provide direct access to an unprecedented amount of content and may amplify rumors and questionable information. Thus, the purpose of this study is to make general evaluations about misinformation that is also known as Infodemic in the social media during Covid 19.
