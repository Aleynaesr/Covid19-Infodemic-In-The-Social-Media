#### _Covid-19 Infodemic and Misinformation In The Social Media_

 
 ## _Step A:Problem Description_
 
#### _Social media appear as very important channel for accessing, producing and sharing news. With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, people turned to social media to read and to share timely information including statistics, warnings, advice, and inspirational stories. Thus, everyone could access and even distribute information about the epidemic. In this case, information began to come from more than one points with right or wrong sources to fill the information gap about Covid 19. Unfortunately, alongside all this useful information, there are also a new blending of misinformation on social media. Accordingly, due to the social panic triggered by the Covid 19 epidemic, it was inevitable that new problems would arise in the field of information and news reliability related to Covid 19 in the social media. As a result, misinformation and conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 pandemic, the source, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of the disease began to spread through social media channels. Especially during the onset and rapid spread of the epidemic in all countries, the increase in the share of unrealistic news that may affect the masses of the disease has reached alarming dimensions. For example, when we have spent time online in the past few months, we probably all feel the difficulty of determining what information about the coronavirus vaccine is reliable and what is not. In this case, false news generally start to spread faster than factual news, in part due to its novelty and its capacity to generate emotive response. Thusly, misinformation as an important problem in the social environment causes rapidly to mislead the society and create perception. As a result of that, in early February 2020, The World Health Organization defined this situation as the Misinformation Pandemic with the term "Infodemic". An infodemic refers too much information including false or misleading information in digital and physical environments during a disease outbreak such as the current pandemic. At the same time, false information is false or inaccurate information intended to be deliberately deceptive. So, an infodemic situation accelerates and sustains misinformation just like the current Covid 19 pandemic. To conclude, I can say that, with the Covid 19 pandemic, excessive information circulating on social media, in other words Infodemic, has brought a new dimension to the problem of misinformation and there is a struggle with both Covid 19 and Infodemic during this pandemic period. In this case, COVID-19 is not only a public health challenge and it’s also a public information challenge._
 

 ## _Introduction_
 
#### _All around the world, the Covid 19 pandemic has created an unprecedented level of knowledge in the social media environment. Thus, the Covid 19 pandemic is accompanied by a worldwide Infodemic and misinformation. In this way Covid 19 was recorded as the first global infodemic. World Health Organization (WHO) named the “over-abundance of information” around the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Thusly, with the coming together of too much information, it caused the wrong and the right to be mixed with each other and the trust in the right information started to be affected as much. In the information age, this Infodemic phenomenon is amplified through social networks, spreading farther and faster like a virus._

 #### _The Story Of Problem_
 
#### _While the whole world is fighting with Covid 19, the increase in the information we face globally and the information pollution that comes with it is spreading rapidly all over the world. Sometimes, in many countries of the world, verification platforms that try to fight fake news have examined thousands of suspicious content and informed their readers by verifying this information, especially from social media. So, my problem is to make general evaluations about the problem of misinformation that is also known as Infodemic in the social media during Covid 19. The main purpose of the study is to inform users or clients who use social media to get information about Covid 19 and to offer suggestions to this problem for users. In this case, the story of the problem is formed around 3 main topics. These are general situation of Turkey, the world and people to this problem. In this way, some relevant analyzes and visualize data will be done to support the story such as general situation of Covid 19 misinformation in the world, Infodemic topics that defined by Verification Platforms about Covid 19, through which channels and people's attitude to this situation on social media. As a result of this study, some suggestions will be given to fight Covid 19 infodemic to the users._


 ## _Step B:Information About Data_
 ## _Visualization Tools_
 
 #### _I prefer to use Google Data Studio and Visme visualization tools because these tools are free and i can visualize my data easily with using different graphs by them._
 
 
 ## _Data Gathering_
 
 
  
#### _I need to collect the necessary data in order to visualize data. In this case, I found the data sets from trusted sources on the Internet and created my own data tables. I divided the time period to collect data for the story of the problem, such as the first time in 2020 when the disease started to spread, 2021 and May. Below are detailed information about the data sets and the addresses of them._
 
 
 * _I found these data sets in the Covid19 Infodemics Observatory website. In this website, there is a file for each country but i use 2 data set file such as World and Turkey. With these data sets, I will use it to visualize the risk of Infodemic in some countries around the world and Turkey in May 2021._
 
 #### _This data set currently includes Infodemic in all countries in the world._

 #### _This data set evaluates Infodemic in Turkey._ 
 
 ------> http://covid19obs.fbk.eu/assets/timeseries/TUR.csv
 
 
 
 * _COVID-19 healthcare misinformation data set includes fake news on websites and social platforms, along with users' social engagement about such news. It includes 5,216 news, 296,752 related user engagements, 958 social platform posts about COVID-19, and ground truth labels. It has 42 files._

 * _FakeCovid is a data set of 7623 fact-checked news articles for COVID-19, collected from 04/01/2020 to 01/07/2020. It has 5 files._

 * _Also, i collected other data sets and created its tables. It is in the data file of my repository. I use these reliable sources as follows._

  ## _The Challenges Of Data Gathering_
 
  
 #### _Infodemic has gained a new dimension with Covid 19. Thus, I encountered some difficulties in collecting the necessary data. I found several data sets on this subject on the Internet, but I had a hard time choosing the right and reliable sources. In this case, I created a list of sources to collect data from the right sources, examined all of them one by one and selected the appropriate data sets from some websites, github and articles. Then, I started collecting data about Covid 19 through the Covid 19 Infodemic Observatory website, which renews the Infodemic risk index every 2 days. I had difficulty in creating a data set by taking the first 15 days of May for whole world and Turkey and saving the Infodemic risk data of every day in an excel file. Through this site, I found the data set containing the Infodemic risk indexes that have existed since the beginning of Covid 19. I studied them and covered the necessary parts. Also, for each data set I found, I made the necessary edits and cleanups and created the table before visualizing it._
